The code and example data file to accompany 'Movement ecology of human resource users: Using net squared displacement, biased random bridges and resource utilisation functions to quantify hunter and gatherer behaviour. ' (https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00189.x)
the code is in the file 'Methods in Ecology and Evolution.R'
The example data is in the file 'Papworth_data.txt'.

This code was written in 2011, and so may need updating to work with newer versions of R and the required packages.
